**noise** is an opinionated, easy-to-use P2P network stack for
*decentralized applications, and cryptographic protocols* written in
[Go](https://golang.org/) by [the Perlin team](https://perlin.net).

**noise** is made to be robust, developer-friendly, performant, secure, and
cross-platform across multitudes of devices by making use of well-tested,
production-grade dependencies.

<hr/>

By itself, **noise** is a low-level, stateless, concurrent networking library that easily allows you to incorporate fundamental features any modern p2p application needs such as:

1) cryptographic primitives (Ed25519, PoW, AES-256),
2) message serialization/deserialization schemes (byte-order little endian, protobuf, msgpack),
3) network timeout/error management (on dial, on receive message, on send buffer full),
4) network-level atomic operations (receive-then-lock),
5) and NAT traversal support (NAT-PMP, UPnP).

Out of its own low-level constructs, noise additionally comes bundled with a high-level `protocol` package comprised of a large number of production-ready, high-level protocol building blocks such as:

1) handshake protocol implementations (Elliptic-Curve Diffie Hellman),
2) peer routing/discovery protocol implementations (S/Kademlia),
3) message broadcasting protocol implementations (S/Kademlia),
4) overlay network protocol implementations (S/Kademlia),
5) cryptographic identity schemes (Ed25519 w/ EdDSA signatures),
6) and authenticated encryption schemes (AES-256 GCM AEAD).

Every single building block is easily configurable, and may be mixed and matched together to help you kickstart your journey on developing secure, debuggable, and highly-performant p2p applications.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/guyu96/noise"
    "github.com/guyu96/noise/cipher/aead"
    "github.com/guyu96/noise/handshake/ecdh"
    "github.com/guyu96/noise/identity/ed25519"
    "github.com/guyu96/noise/protocol"
    "github.com/guyu96/noise/rpc"
    "github.com/guyu96/noise/skademlia"
)

type chatMessage struct {
	text string
}

func (chatMessage) Read(reader payload.Reader) (noise.Message, error) {
	text, err := reader.ReadString()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "failed to read chat msg")
	}

	return chatMessage{text: text}, nil
}

func (m chatMessage) Write() []byte {
	return payload.NewWriter(nil).WriteString(m.text).Bytes()
}

func main() {
    // Register message type to Noise.
    opcodeChatMessage := noise.RegisterMessage(noise.NextAvailableOpcode(), (*chatMessage)(nil))

    params := noise.DefaultParams()
    params.Keys = ed25519.Random()
    params.Port = uint16(3000)

    node, err := noise.NewNode(params)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    protocol.New().
    	Register(ecdh.New()).
    	Register(aead.New()).
    	Register(skademlia.New()).
    	Enforce(node)

    fmt.Printf("Listening for peers on port %d.\n", node.ExternalPort())

    go node.Listen()

    // Dial peer via TCP located at address 127.0.0.1:3001.
    peer, err := node.Dial("127.0.0.1:3001")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Wait until the peer has finished all cryptographic handshake procedures.
    skademlia.WaitUntilAuthenticated(peer)

    // Send a single chat message over the peer knowing that it's encrypted over the wire.
    err = peer.SendMessage(chatMessage{text: "Hello peer!"})
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Receive and print out a single chat message back from our peer.
    fmt.Println(<-peer.Receive(opcodeChatMessage))
}
```

## Setup

Make sure to have at the bare minimum [Go 1.11](https://golang.org/dl/) installed before incorporating **noise** into your project.

After installing _Go_, you may choose to either:

1. directly incorporate noise as a library dependency to your project,

```bash
# Be sure to have Go modules enabled: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules
export GO111MODULE=on

# Run this inside your projects directory.
go get github.com/guyu96/noise
```

2. or checkout the source code on Github and run any of the following commands below.

```bash
# Be sure to have Go modules enabled: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules
export GO111MODULE=on

# Run an example creating a cluster of 3 peers automatically
# discovering one another.
[terminal 1] go run examples/chat/main.go -p 3000
[terminal 2] go run examples/chat/main.go -p 3001 127.0.0.1:3000
[terminal 3] go run examples/chat/main.go -p 3002 127.0.0.1:3001

# Optionally run test cases.
go test -v -count=1 -race ./...
```

## We're hiring!

Here at [Perlin](https://perlin.net), we spend days and weeks debating, tinkering, and researching what is out there in academia to bring to industries truly resilient, open-source, secure, economic, and decentralized software to empower companies, startups, and users.

Our doors are open to academics that have a knack for distributed systems, engineers that want to explore unknown waters, frontend developers that want to make and evangelize the next generation of customer-facing applications, and graphics designers that yearn to instrument together greater user experiences for decentralized applications.

## Contributions

First of all, _thank you so much_ for taking part in our efforts for creating a p2p networking stack that can meet everyones needs without sacrificing developer productivity!

All code contributions to _noise_ should comply with all idiomatic Go standards listed [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).

All commit messages should be in the format:

```bash
module_name_1, module_name_2: description of the changes you made to the two
    modules here as a sentence
```

Be sure to use only imperative, present tense within your commit messages and optionally include motivation for your changes _two lines breaks_ away from your commit message.

This allows other maintainers and contributors to know which modules you are modifying/creating within the code/docs repository.

Lastly, be sure to consider backwards compatibility.

New modules/methods are perfectly fine, but changing code living in `noise.Node` or `noise.Peer` radically for example would break a lot of existing projects utilizing _noise_.

Additionally, if you'd like to talk to us or any of the team in real-time, be sure to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dMYfDPM)!

We are heavily active, ready to answer any questions/assist you with any code/doc contributions at almost any time.
